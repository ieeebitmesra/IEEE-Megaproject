# Idea
The idea of our project was to create a website where people can get the news and all the data of the stock 
        markets which will assist them in their future investment.<br>
       We came up with this idea because only 3% of the Indians are currently investing in stock market which 
        is incomparable to the 60% and above in USA which I guess is the reason for our country to be still 
        counted as a developing country.<br>And so we took an initiative to reach out to people throughour website 
        and generate a sense of awareness about stock market.<br>
       We wish that our website reaches each and every corner of India and everyone starts investing in stock market.

# Achievements 
1. We were able to show various news articles about the stock market and any desired topic of the user 
                    which keeps the share holders updated about the events in the markets.<br>
2. We were able to provide the latest top gainers, top losers and most active stock of the share market 
                    across the globe along with a search bar to get a brief detail about their desired stocks so that 
                      they can get the info about the risk as well as the profit
                        which they can perceive in the market.<br>
3. We added a chat messenger where we can answer to any queries of the user related to the website.<br>
4. We have added a contact form where people can personally contact us and give a 
                    vivid description about their experience on our website.
