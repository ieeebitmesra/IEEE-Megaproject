# About the Event
"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships." â€“ Michael Jordan

After six successful editions, we are here to present you with an opportunity of prototyping your imagination with the IEEE Mega Project.

IEEE Mega Project is a platform to learn and experience the entire process of making a project, from ideation to execution and then it's presentation. It is a platform for students to showcase their innovative ideas in working.
It's a team-based project building event, where college students collaborate together to bring their ideas to reality.
