DOMAIN:
Android App Development

IDEA:
Our goal is to create a one-stop solution app for all Bitian students. Everything important and related to a student will be regularly updated and properly displayed on our app. Regular announcement updates from clubs, updates about upcoming meetings and classes, contact info useful to students, bus schedules, course syllabus, and everything important to know about any particular club will be displayed systematically for the ease of understanding of the student. Club Officials will also benefit heavily by efficiently managing their respective clubs through this platform. With our app in place, officials and students will have all the information they might ever need right on their fingertips.  Thank you.

ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Implemented signup and login features for users.
- Setup auto generated e-mails which are being sent to users with reset password link in case they forget their password.
- Imported the entire college directory into our app and displayed it systematically for ease of understanding.
- Made a section within our app through which users can directly log into the college erp without the hassle of switching to a web browser.
- Made a complete directory of all the clubs functioning within BIT Mesra with every information about every club just a click away.
- Made a section within our app through which users can easily access the map.
- Users have a auto-generated user-profile page which can be used as a medium to share one's info related to college with friends.
- Made an announcements section which reflects any news updates on the official BIT Mesra site to the app.
