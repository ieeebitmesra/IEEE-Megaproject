# Skill Hub

## Domain 

The project is a mobile application developed in Flutter using Dart as a programming language, wireframe as UI and Firestore as backend server. This app can be operated in both iOS and Anroid  

## Idea

The idea of the project is as an intra-organizational employment-oriented service that operates via mobile apps. 
The organization that we have used as a test case is BIT Mesra, however, it can be oriented towards any other organization as well. The main goal is to bring convenience to freelancers and startups to hire people from within the community from where they are based.<br />
The app can be very useful to foster expirence of networking to those who has no prior industry exprence and also to those looking for a cost competative employbility from within their organizational structure. 

# Achievements
