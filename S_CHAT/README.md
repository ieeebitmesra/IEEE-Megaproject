## Tech

Team Noob uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Flutter] - version 2.8.0 framework for android apps!
- [[Django](https://github.com/vishalsharma0657/schat-backend.git)] - Django provides fast and secure backend.
- [Fire_Base] - Fire_base provides one time password for verification in S_Chat application.
- [Mongo_DB] - Mongo_db provides database to the application for storing messages and user detail in encrypted format.

And of course S_Chat itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
